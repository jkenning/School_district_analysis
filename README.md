## Overview of Project

The project scenario involves the analysis, reporting, and presentation of all standardized test data for a city school district. Data on student funding, their standardized test scores (including math and reading scores), and additional information about the schools they attend is aggregated to showcase trends in performance. 

Key Deliverables:

* High level overview table of the district's key metrics
* Overview table for key metrics for each school
* Tables presenting the following metrics:
    - Top 5 and bottom performing schools based on pass rate
    - Average math score for students in each grade level at each school
    - Average reading score for students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on budget per student
    - School performance based on school size
    - School performance based on the type of school

### Purpose

The aim is to provide insights about performance trends and patterns found in the student test data across different schools. These insights can be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level, including determining school budgets and priorities going forward.
